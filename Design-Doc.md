# ThreadTheory-AI Design Document

## üß† Overview

**ThreadTheory-AI** is a proof-of-concept full-stack platform that combines fashion forecasting with brand storytelling through AI. The application predicts SKU-level performance using a time-series forecasting model and generates brand-aligned product descriptions using LLMs. Built for fashion buyers, merchandisers, and sales associates, the system enhances both product strategy and retail communication.

This project showcases:
- LLM integration with LangChain
- RESTful backend API with FastAPI
- Frontend using React and TailwindCSS
- PostgreSQL database
- Cloud deployment using AWS EC2

## üîß Backend

- **Language**: Python  
- **Framework**: FastAPI  
- **Endpoints**:
  - `GET /products` - List all products
  - `GET /products/{id}` - Product detail
  - `POST /forecast` - Run forecasting model on product
  - `POST /generate-description` - Generate LLM-based description
  - `POST /upload-sales` - Ingest sales CSV

- **Tools**:
  - `SQLAlchemy` for ORM
  - `pydantic` for validation
  - `uvicorn` for local dev

---

## üìä Forecasting Model (SKU Performance)

- **Model**: Facebook Prophet or ARIMA (for time series forecasting)
- **Input**: Historical sales from `sales_data`
- **Output**: Predicted revenue, units sold, and stock signals
- **Granularity**: Product + region level

---

## üí¨ LLM Description Generator

- **Tool**: LangChain with OpenAI/GPT backend
- **Inputs**: Product name, category, brand, tone
- **Output**: Description + story-style summary
- **Enhancements**:
  - Custom prompts per persona
  - Integration of macro/cultural signals in copy

---

## üé® Frontend

- **Framework**: React.js or Next.js  
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS (or Chakra UI as an alternative)  
- **Key Pages**:
  - Dashboard: Product list and insights
  - Forecast View: Time-series visualizations
  - Description Generator: Inputs and outputs of LLM
  - Upload Page: For ingesting new sales data

---

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Infrastructure

- **Platform**: AWS  
  - **EC2**: Hosts backend + frontend
  - **RDS**: PostgreSQL managed database (optional)
  - **S3**: (Optional) For file uploads or image storage
- **Deployment**:
  - Docker container for backend
  - CI/CD with GitHub Actions (optional)

---

## üìà Example Flow

1. User uploads sales data (CSV).
2. Backend parses and stores data in `sales_data`.
3. Forecasting API runs time-series model ‚Üí returns SKU insights.
4. LLM prompt crafted using product metadata ‚Üí returns branded copy.
5. Frontend displays both insights and descriptions for download or presentation.
